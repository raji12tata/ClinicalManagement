Clinical Management System (CMS)

Project Overview

This is a simple offline health management system built using C++.
The system is designed to provide essential functionalities for managing patient medical records, and language support (Afan_Oromo and English). It offers a basic yet effective solution for health management in offline environments, focusing on user-friendliness and practical implementation.
Problem It Solves

Many healthcare systems in Ethiopia either require internet access or are overly complex for local communities. This system can  solves the issue by providing an offline-based, easy-to-understand solution. It also offers a user-friendly interface with bilingual support.
What it can do:

Store and update patient medical information (including searching, displaying, and deleting records).
View and update patient details and records.
Support for bilingual language options (Afan_Oromo and English).
Admin functionality to view and manage all system data.

Tools and Concepts Used

C++ console application.
File handling for storing and retrieving data.
Structs for organizing data related to patients 
Basic arrays and data management without the use of complex libraries.
Offline functionality, making it accessible without an internet connection.

How to Run

Clone or download the project files.
Use any C++ compiler like g++ or CodeBlocks.
Compile all “.cpp” files and execute the output file to run the system.

Project Phases

Phase 1: Learn basics of C++ with simple file handling and struct usage.

Phase 2: Implement data management for  patient records.

Phase 3: Incorporate language options and final testing for offline usability.

Unique Features of the Project

Fully offline system with no need for internet access.
Bilingual interface in Oromic and English.
Simple and intuitive enough to be used on basic computers for local health centers.

Skills You Will Learn

Real C++ coding skills for practical applications in healthcare.
File handling and data management techniques.
System design and basic problem-solving in health management.
Debugging and clean, modular code writing for efficient performance.
